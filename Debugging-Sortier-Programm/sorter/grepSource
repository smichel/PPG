# Usage:
#
# This script is a grep-wrapper to search in all source code files recognized by the generic Makefile. Pass it a grep pattern and any other grep options you like, they are simply forwarded, but there is no need to specify any files to search.
#
# If the first argument is --use-red, a different color scheme is used and this argument is stripped before the other arguments are passed to grep.
